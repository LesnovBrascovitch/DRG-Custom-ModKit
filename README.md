## DRG-Custom-ModKit
This project is based on Buckminsterfullerene02's ModKit, Currently this project is quite work-in-progress. It should be useful for animation and weapon related modding at the moment.  
This Mod Kit recreated some C++ codes and materials, BPs, animations, anim notifies etc to make some modding(such as animation, custom weapon, player character related) easier.  
You can make DRG mod in the editor and migrate to DRG without using additional framework(If you use recreated C++ source's functions).  

## Notes
- Currently including many sources from various modders to make it faster to understand how the DRG's function works. (These might be removed in the future)
- Other modder's DRG sources are moved to under _DRGModding folder.
